# StudentManagementProject

# Description:
The StudentManagementProject is a web-based application designed to manage student information in a school or educational institution. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records, providing a user-friendly interface for administrators or staff members to interact with the student data.

# Technologies Used:
- Java: The primary programming language used for backend development.
- Spring Framework: Utilized for building the backend of the application, including the Spring MVC architecture for handling web requests.
- Thymeleaf: Employed as the templating engine for server-side rendering of HTML views in the Spring MVC application.
- Bootstrap: Integrated for responsive and visually appealing front-end design.
- Hibernate (JPA): Used for data persistence, mapping Java objects to database entities.
- MySQL: Chosen as the relational database management system to store and retrieve student data.
- HTML/CSS: Frontend markup and styling.
- Gradle (or Maven): Build and dependency management.

# Lessons Learned:
- Spring MVC: Gained proficiency in developing web applications using the Spring MVC framework, including controllers, services, and repositories.
- Thymeleaf Templating: Acquired skills in using Thymeleaf for server-side HTML rendering in a Spring application.
- Database Interaction: Learned how to integrate Hibernate and JPA for seamless interaction between the application and a relational database.
- CRUD Operations: Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing student records.
- Frontend Design: Utilized Bootstrap for creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
